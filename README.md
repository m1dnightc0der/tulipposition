Tulip positions in python

Midnight Coder

Version 1.0

2022-01-17

## Release notes

## Description

**tulipposition** is the open source tool for retrieving leverage postions from tulip via solana rpc.

## Dependencies

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full details.

Make sure you get the python3 versions of the relevant packages, i.e. use: (in linux)

```
sudo pip3 install ....
```

(Your machine may not need pip3 if python3 is the default python on your machine)

## Installation

This package isn't hosted on pip. So to get the code the easiest way is to use git:

```
git clone https://github.com/m1dnightc0der/tulipposition.git
python3 setup.py install # normal
```

Again, you may be okay with python rather than python3.

### A note on support

This is an open source project, designed for people who are already comfortable using and writing python code, are capable of installing the dependencies. I do not have the time to provide support. Primarily, this is a tool you are welcome to use or steal code from, I'm open sourcing it out of the goodness of my heart not so I can become an unpaid technical support helper to hundreds of strangers. Of course I am very happy if you get in touch with me on any of the following topics:

- Confusing error messages
- Missing or misleading documentation
- Suggestions for extra features
 
However I can't guarantee that I will reply immediately, or at all. If you need that level of support then you are better off with another project. The most efficient way of doing this is by [opening an issue on github](https://github.com/m1dnightc0der/tulipposition/issues/new). If you discover a bug please include:

- The full script that produces the error, including all `import` statements, or if it's a standard example file a pointer to the file. Ideally this should be a "minimal example" - the shortest possible script that produces the problem.
- Versions of any necessary libraries you have installed
- The full output trace including the error messages

If you don't include the information above I will close the issue and then ignore it.

I'll try and incorporate any feedback into the code, but this is a part time (and unpaid!) venture for me, and it will be competing with my other interests. Offers to contribute will of course be gratefully accepted.
